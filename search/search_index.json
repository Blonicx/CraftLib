An example for that is the Particles Class. It can be used like this:</p> <pre><code>import dev.blonicx.craftlib.api.particle.Particles;\n\n// From Version 1.21.8 and above, you can't clear all Particles using the Built-In Particle Engine because the methode is private.\n// CraftLib makes that Possible!\nParticles.ENGINE.clearParticles();\n</code></pre> <p>Another useful thing is the GlobalIdentifier. With that you can make a ResourceLocation and Identifier at the same Time. An example would be:</p> <pre><code>import dev.blonicx.craftlib.api.identifier.GlobalIdentifier;\nimport dev.blonicx.craftlib.api.identifier.GlobalIdentifiers;\n\npublic static &lt;GenericItem extends Item&gt; GenericItem register(String name, Function&lt;Item.Properties, GenericItem&gt; itemFactory, Item.Properties settings) {\n    // Create an GlobalIdentifier\n    GlobalIdentifier id = GlobalIdentifiers.of(ExampleMod.MOD_ID, name);\n\n    // Create the item key.\n    ResourceKey&lt;Item&gt; itemKey = ResourceKey.create(Registries.ITEM, id.unwrap());\n\n    // Create the item instance.\n    GenericItem item = itemFactory.apply(settings.setId(itemKey));\n\n    // Register the item.\n    Registry.register(BuiltInRegistries.ITEM, itemKey, item);\n\n    return item;\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"api/legal/jquery/","title":"Jquery","text":""},{"location":"api/legal/jquery/#jquery-v371","title":"jQuery v3.7.1","text":""},{"location":"api/legal/jquery/#jquery-license","title":"jQuery License","text":"<pre><code>jQuery v 3.7.1\nCopyright OpenJS Foundation and other contributors, https://openjsf.org/\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
